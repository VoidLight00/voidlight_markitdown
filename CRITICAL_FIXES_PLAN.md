# VoidLight MarkItDown Critical Fixes Plan

## 1. Architecture Alignment (Priority: CRITICAL)

### Problem
- Original: Stream-based architecture using BinaryIO
- VoidLight: File path-based architecture
- This fundamental difference breaks compatibility

### Solution
1. Rewrite `_base_converter.py` to match original architecture
2. Update all converters to use `accepts()` and `convert()` with BinaryIO
3. Implement StreamInfo properly
4. Make all converters work with streams, not file paths

## 2. Test Suite Failures (Priority: HIGH)

### Problem
- Many pytest tests fail due to architecture mismatch
- 6 Korean tests failing
- Original tests can't run on current architecture

### Solution
1. Fix architecture first
2. Run all pytest tests and fix failures one by one
3. Ensure 100% of original tests pass
4. Fix Korean test failures

## 3. Korean NLP Verification (Priority: HIGH)

### Problem
- Korean NLP libraries not actually tested
- Only fallback methods working
- Java dependencies not verified

### Solution
1. Install Java runtime
2. Install and test KoNLPy with Java
3. Install and test Kiwipiepy
4. Verify all NLP features actually work
5. Create integration tests

## 4. Missing Converter Dependencies (Priority: MEDIUM)

### Problem
- Only 11/18 converters working
- Important ones like DOCX, XLSX, PDF not tested
- Optional dependencies not installed

### Solution
1. Install ALL optional dependencies
2. Test each converter with real files
3. Fix any issues found
4. Document actual requirements

## 5. Production Features (Priority: MEDIUM)

### Problem
- No proper logging system
- Basic error handling only
- No performance testing

### Solution
1. Implement proper logging with Python logging module
2. Add comprehensive error handling
3. Test with large files (>100MB)
4. Add performance benchmarks

## Implementation Order
1. Architecture alignment (most critical)
2. Fix test suite
3. Verify Korean NLP
4. Test all converters
5. Add production features
