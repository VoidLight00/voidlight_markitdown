# MCP HTTP/SSE Implementation Summary

## Overview
The VoidLight MarkItDown MCP server HTTP/SSE implementation has been successfully validated and documented. No server code changes were required - the implementation was already correct and compliant with the MCP specification.

## Work Completed

### 1. Issue Analysis
- Identified that HTTP/SSE mode was returning 406 errors
- Discovered the root cause: test scripts were missing required Accept headers
- Confirmed server implementation follows MCP Streamable HTTP specification

### 2. Fix Implementation
- **No server code changes required** - the implementation was correct
- Fixed test scripts to include proper headers: `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream`
- Updated test methods to use correct JSON-RPC method names (`tools/call` not `call_tool`)

### 3. Documentation Created

#### Created Files:
1. **`MCP_HTTP_SSE_FIX_REPORT.md`** - Comprehensive fix report explaining the issue and solution
2. **`test_mcp_http_direct.py`** - Clean test script demonstrating correct HTTP/SSE usage
3. **`test_mcp_sse_fixed.py`** - Advanced SSE test with session management
4. **`example_mcp_http_client.py`** - Example client implementation for users
5. **`MCP_HTTP_SSE_IMPLEMENTATION_SUMMARY.md`** - This summary document

#### Updated Files:
1. **`test_mcp_server.py`** - Fixed Accept headers and endpoint URLs
2. **`packages/voidlight_markitdown-mcp/README.md`** - Added HTTP/SSE client requirements section

## Key Findings

### Server Implementation
- The server correctly implements MCP protocol version 2025-06-18
- Endpoints are properly configured:
  - `/mcp` - Main Streamable HTTP endpoint
  - `/sse` - Server-Sent Events endpoint
  - `/messages/` - SSE message posting endpoint
- Session management via `Mcp-Session-Id` header is properly implemented

### Client Requirements
Clients must:
1. Send `Accept: application/json, text/event-stream` header
2. Use the base `/mcp` endpoint for all JSON-RPC requests
3. Include session ID in subsequent requests if provided

### Test Results
- STDIO mode: ✅ Working (unchanged)
- HTTP/SSE mode: ✅ Working (after fixing client headers)
- All MCP methods tested successfully:
  - `initialize`
  - `tools/list`
  - `tools/call`

## Example Usage

```python
# Correct HTTP client usage
headers = {
    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
    'Accept': 'application/json, text/event-stream'  # Required!
}

# Initialize
response = requests.post('http://localhost:3001/mcp', 
    json={"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "initialize", "params": {...}, "id": 1},
    headers=headers)

# Extract session ID if provided
session_id = response.headers.get('Mcp-Session-Id')
if session_id:
    headers['Mcp-Session-Id'] = session_id

# Call tools
response = requests.post('http://localhost:3001/mcp',
    json={"jsonrpc": "2.0", "method": "tools/call", "params": {...}, "id": 2},
    headers=headers)
```

## Recommendations

1. **For Users**: Always include the proper Accept header when using HTTP/SSE mode
2. **For Documentation**: The README has been updated with clear client requirements
3. **For Testing**: Use the provided example client and test scripts as reference
4. **For Production**: The HTTP/SSE implementation is production-ready

## Conclusion

The VoidLight MarkItDown MCP server's HTTP/SSE implementation is fully functional, compliant with the MCP specification, and ready for production use. The perceived issues were due to incorrect client configuration, not server implementation problems. With proper documentation and example code, users can now successfully utilize the HTTP/SSE transport mode.
