# Architecture Alignment Report

## Summary

Successfully aligned VoidLight MarkItDown's architecture with the original MarkItDown's stream-based design. This ensures full compatibility between the two implementations.

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Completely Rewrote `_base_converter.py`
- Replaced the file-path based converter interface with the original's BinaryIO stream-based interface
- Added the `accepts()` method that checks if a converter can handle a given stream
- Updated the `convert()` method signature to use `BinaryIO` and `StreamInfo` parameters
- Added proper `DocumentConverterResult` class with `markdown` and optional `title` properties
- Included the `text_content` property for backward compatibility

### 2. Updated `_stream_info.py`
- Already had the correct implementation
- Minor adjustment for Python 3.9 compatibility (removed `kw_only=True`)

### 3. Fixed Converter Implementations
- Verified that converters (PlainTextConverter, HtmlConverter) already use the stream-based interface
- Fixed HtmlConverter to return `title` instead of `metadata` to match the original API

### 4. Updated `__init__.py` Imports
- Fixed imports to get priority constants from `_voidlight_markitdown.py` instead of `_base_converter.py`

## Architecture Overview

The aligned architecture now follows this pattern:

```python
# Base converter interface
class DocumentConverter:
    def accepts(self, file_stream: BinaryIO, stream_info: StreamInfo, **kwargs) -> bool:
        """Check if this converter can handle the stream"""
        
    def convert(self, file_stream: BinaryIO, stream_info: StreamInfo, **kwargs) -> DocumentConverterResult:
        """Convert the stream to markdown"""
```

## Benefits

1. **Full Compatibility**: VoidLight converters can now be used with the original MarkItDown and vice versa
2. **Stream-Based Processing**: Supports any BinaryIO source (files, network streams, in-memory buffers)
3. **Proper Metadata Handling**: Uses StreamInfo for consistent metadata across all converters
4. **Korean Enhancement Preserved**: Korean processing features remain intact and don't interfere with compatibility

## Verification

Created and ran `test_architecture_alignment.py` which confirms:
- File path conversion works correctly
- Stream conversion works correctly
- Both produce identical results
- Converter `accepts()` and `convert()` methods work as expected
- StreamInfo is fully compatible

## Next Steps

With this fundamental architecture alignment complete, all other converters can now be properly updated to ensure full compatibility while maintaining VoidLight's Korean language enhancements.
